Abstract:
Differentiating Vertebral Compression Fractures (VCFs) associated with trauma and osteoporosis (benign VCFs) or those caused by metastatic cancer (malignant VCFs) is critically important for treatment decisions. So far, automatic VCFs diagnosis is solved in a two-step manner, i.e., first identify VCFs and then classify them into benign or malignant. In this paper, we explore to model VCFs diagnosis as a three-class classification problem, i.e., normal vertebrae, benign VCFs, and malignant VCFs. However, VCFs recognition and classification require very different features, and both tasks are characterized by high intra-class variation and high inter-class similarity. Moreover, the dataset is extremely class-imbalanced. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Two-Stream Compare and Contrast Network (TSCCN) for VCFs diagnosis. This network consists of two streams, a recognition stream which learns to identify VCFs through comparing and contrasting between adjacent vertebrae, and a classification stream which compares and contrasts between intra-class and inter-class to learn features for fine-grained classification. The two streams are integrated via a learnable weight control module which adaptively sets their contribution. TSCCN is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 239 VCFs patients and achieves the average sensitivity and specificity of 92.56% and 96.29%, respectively.

I. Introduction
Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are associated with back pain, disability, and limitation of spine mobility which leads to health-related deterioration of quality of life [1], [2]. The causes of VCFs include trauma, osteoporosis, and neoplastic infiltration. VCFs caused by trauma and osteoporosis are generally benign, whose incidence rate increases with age. Certain cancers, such as thyroid and breast cancer which have a propensity to metastasize to bone, can lead to malignant VCFs [3]. Differentiating between benign and malignant VCFs is critically important for the treatment and prognostic of patients. MRI is considered to be the most reliable imaging method for spine diseases [4]. Signal intensity and shape of vertebral bodies are important imaging features when diagnosing VCFs in MRI [5], [6]. Spectral and fractal features [7] that are related to signal intensity, and compactness and convex deficiency features [8] that are related to shape, were widely employed for VCFs diagnosis.
