        # Welcome to MediaX@SJTU (ä¸Šäº¤æ™ºèƒ½åª’ä½“ç»„)  


        **MediaX** is a research group of Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**. We target top-tier research at the intersection of **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **generative intelligent media**.  


        We aim to push the boundaries of **multi-modal media (2D/3D/4D)** in the following areas:  
        - Generation  
        - Restoration and Enhancement  
        - Reconstruction and Compression  
        - Quality Assessment  


        Our mission is to develop intelligent systems that can understand, model, and manipulate complex human-centric visual content, enabling the high-quality and efficient creation of next-generation intelligent media.  


        ## ðŸŽ¯ Research Focus  

        - **Image and Video Restoration & Enhancement**  
          High-resolution (4K/8K) quality restoration, super-resolution, and controllable editing of visual content.  

        - **2D/3D/4D Generation, Representation & Compression**  
          Efficient modeling and compact representation of dynamic scenes for immersive media.  

        - **Multi-Modal Perception & Quality Assessment**  
          Developing perceptual and semantic-aware evaluation systems for UGC, PGC, and AIGC content.  

        - **Language-Guided Generation & Understanding**  
          Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion frameworks to guide controllable generation and forgery detection.  

        - **Interactive & Automated Media Creation Systems**  
          Building collaborative, multi-agent platforms for intelligent content production and human-in-the-loop media editing.  


        ## ðŸ“¢ Join Us  

        We are always looking for **self-motivated PhD students, Master's students, and undergraduate research assistants** to join our team.  
        If you're passionate about intelligent media and generative AI, please send your **CV and transcript** to: *mediax@sjtu.edu.cn*
